ESPADAYSANTACRUZ is a creative studio specialized in generating new interactive and visual experiences. Based in Madrid since 2008, we design projects where technology allows us to bring creative ideas to a new aesthetic dimension.

Our ongoing research makes every project unique. We are involved throughout the creative process, from the research stage to the manufacturing of the final product, because this is how we manage to create works which are alive and have their own personality.

We work with agencies, production companies, businesses and cultural organizations which are trying to find new ways of communication by firmly betting on innovation and creativity. We work with those who see, as we do, a new way to convey their ideas in the countless technological possibilities of our time.

We conceive each project as an organic entity in which the different technologies and visual proposals work harmoniously, without eclipsing one another. The span of our work goes from classical visual technologies, such as photography and the audiovisual, to cutting edge technologies, such as interactive installations, online apps, interactive video mapping or data visualization.

The studio's members are professionals with different backgrounds in the fields of information technology, audiovisual creation, photography and cultural management. We also rely upon a large team of collaborators with whom we share the same vision of work and visual experimentation.
